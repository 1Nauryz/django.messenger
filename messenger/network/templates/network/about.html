                1.3 billion people around the world use Messenger every month to message, video chat and plan things—all in one place.
                <br>
                The app makes it easy to message almost anyone — even without being friends on Facebook or having their phone
                <br> number. On Messenger anyone can show their reaction, share photos and videos, send money easily and securely*,
                <br> share their location, play games and much more. Beyond connecting with friends, it has also become a thriving channel
                <br> for brands, developers and consumers to connect with each other and the things they love.

                Messenger Kids is a free video calling and messaging app designed for kids to connect with close friends and family
                <br> from their tablet or smartphone. Group or one-on-one video calls with loved ones are more fun with interactive masks,
                <br> reactions and sound effects. Parents manage the contact list and decide who can connect with their children. Messages
                <br> don’t disappear and can’t be hidden in case parents would like to check in. Messenger Kids allows kids to message and
                <br> video call using Wi-Fi so they don’t need a phone number.
